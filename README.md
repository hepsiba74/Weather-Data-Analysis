# Weather-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes daily weather data using Python to explore patterns and predict rainfall through linear regression, showing that temperature variations help forecast rainfall.
# 1. Data Exploration: 
      We loaded the weather dataset, examined its structure, and summarized key statistics to understand the     data.
# 2. Data Visualization: 
     We visualized relationships between weather variables using pair plots, bar charts, and scatter plots.
# 3. Feature Engineering: 
    We created a new feature, Temperature Difference (TempDiff), by subtracting MinTemp from MaxTemp.
# 4. Statistical Analysis: 
    We calculated the average maximum temperature based on WindGust direction to identify trends.
# 5. Additional Visualizations: 
    Scatter plots were used to examine the correlation between TempDiff and Rainfall.
# 6. Advanced Analysis: 
    We applied Linear Regression to predict rainfall using MinTemp and MaxTemp as input features.
# 7. Model Evaluation: 
    The model's performance was assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared scores.
# 8. Results and Insights: 
    We compared predicted rainfall with actual values and visualized the outcomes using graphs and tables.
